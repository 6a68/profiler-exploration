Setting up some test files for exercising browser profiler tools.

Some things we can play around with:
* create a ton of DOM nodes
* add a ton of listeners to DOM nodes
* parse a ton of JSON
* be stupid about repainting as much as possible
* do stupid recursion (might crash the browser too quickly though)
* throw lots and lots of uncaught Exceptions
* console.log LIKE A BAWS

Have ideas for ways to (gradually, reproducibly) crash your browser? Pull requests welcome.
